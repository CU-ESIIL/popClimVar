# popClimVar

Welcome to the `popClimVar` repository, an integral part of the Environmental Data Science Innovation and Inclusion Lab (ESIIL). This repository is the central hub for our working group, encompassing our project overview, proposals, team member information, codebase, and more.

## Our Project
Climate change is expected to alter global temperature and precipitation patterns in multiple ways, including increases in mean temperatures, more variable precipitation patterns and extreme events, and more autocorrelated climate across space and time. These multiple dimensions of shifting climate are already exhibiting large impacts on our ecosystems, and are predicted to continue affecting population and community dynamics, with implications for species extinction risk and food security. However, how climate variability will impact population and community dynamics depends on ecological sensitivity to climate drivers and speciesâ€™ abilities to buffer dynamics during adverse conditions. Our group will integrate climate and multiple ecological data sources to link climatic variability with population and community variability across the US, providing insight into potential ecological impacts under future climate change scenarios. In doing so, we aim to additionally provide a synthetic understanding of variability as a measure, bridging standard measures with more complex metrics that consider temporal autocorrelation (i.e., noise
color), nonequilibrium conditions (i.e. comparing stochastic distributions through time), and spatiotemporal patterns (spatial synchrony). This will highlight the multiple dimensions of potential climate change impacts, using consistent spatiotemporal metrics that link from climate to ecological impacts.
